- question: How long does shipping take?
  answer: |-
    Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

      - US shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
      - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
      - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
- question: How do refunds and returns work?
  answer: |-
    It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

      - All discounted items sales are final.
      - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
      - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
